# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
SSRF is a vulnerability that allows the attacker to send requests on a behalf of a sever, therefore allowing the attacker to access services that requires higher prrivleges, sensitive data they are not allowed to access.
# Mechanism
Imagine we have  a company/network that has a public server at `http://public.example.com` and this server has a proxy service that fetches web pages by defining their URL in a `url` query parameter and displays it to the user, `http://public.example.com/proxy?url=www.google.com` -> this fetches `google.com page` to the user.</br>
And imagine there is another internal service at `http://admin.example.com`, that can be accessed only by internal employess of the company (By checking the IPs of their hosts) and is restricted to be reached out via the internet. IF no SSRF protection is applied on the public server, the attacker can trick the public server into sending the request and access the internal services (in this case, fetch the admin panel) since the server is in the same network (trusted IP) by accessing this URL, `http://public.example.com/proxy?url=http://admin.example.com`.</br>
***Why this happened?*** Because the protection that hides admin panels from the internet do not apply to the requests sent between the server and the admin panel server.</br>
