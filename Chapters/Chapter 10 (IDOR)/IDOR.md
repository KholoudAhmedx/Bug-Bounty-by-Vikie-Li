# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
**IDORs** are type of bugs where the application grants access to resources based on user's request without validation.</br>
# Mechanisms
IDOR is essentially a missing access control.</br>
When an application allows users to access resources that don't belong to them by directly referencing the object ID, object number of file name, **that's when IDOR happens**.
